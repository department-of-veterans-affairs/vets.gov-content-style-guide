# Content Substance (What content do we need?)

Each piece of content on vets.gov has a purpose. It should:
-	**Inform:** provide the user with information on the specific benefit and eligibility criteria
-	**Instruct:** tell the user how to complete a task step-by-step (this may be a referral to another site or it may be a “self-serve” task that can be completed on vets.gov)
-	**Support and validate:** give the user access to status updates, answers to questions, next steps, and options to appeal

vets.gov is a transactional site. This means content is designed to support user tasks. The process for identifying new content should look like:
-	What is the task that users need to complete?
-	Is there content elsewhere on the site that instructs/supports this task? 
  - If YES, crosslink and/or re-purpose
  - If NO, create new content (following workflow detailed below)

We will link to high-quality, accurate content that exists on other websites – rather than duplicating that content on vets.gov. 
-	Steer users toward related information that supports their task
-	Encourage users to seek additional support and/or services
-	See Linking Policy and Quality Guidelines for more information

### Health Content
Health content on vets.gov is for Veterans and their family members. This means that it:
-	Supports Veteran health-related transactions on vets.gov (for example, applying for VA health care, refilling a prescription, or downloading health records)
-	Provides information written for a Veteran audience about common conditions, treatments, medical tests, mental health, and prevention and wellness, with a focus on conditions and issues specific to Veterans
-	Provides information on VA health services, including recommended services and where and how Veterans can access health care both within VA and elsewhere

vets.gov content does not include:
-	Content written for VA staff or medical personnel, health professionals, and other service providers 
- Descriptions of VA health policies or VA programs
