# Quality Guidelines and Linking Policy

The goal of vets.gov is to provide easy-to-understand information and tools to help Veterans discover, apply for, track, and manage the benefits they have earned. To achieve this mission, we apply the following quality guidelines when developing original content on vets.gov. When selecting the organizations and resources we link to, the vets.gov team reviews and considers resources that, at a minimum, meet the required quality guidelines. (Adapted from: https://healthfinder.gov/aboutus/QualityGuidelines.aspx)

-	The names of the site developers, sponsors, partners, and funding sources are clearly noted
-	The purpose of the site and its intended audiences are clearly stated
-	“Advertisement” labels clearly identify and separate ads from other information
-	Information is reliable and current. This means “Last updated” and/or “last reviewed” date stamps are posted on the homepage, major entry points, and individual documents

In addition, we are required to honor the rules that govern all of our Internet activities; those activities include posting links to specific types of information as required by law and posting other links on VA web pages that are deemed appropriate because they serve the mission of VA and are relevant and useful to VA's website visitors.
