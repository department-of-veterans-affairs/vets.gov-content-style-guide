# Site Navigation (Language and Conventions)

## Bread Crumbs

This IA element shows the Veteran the path to the current page or where the page lives in the IA (not all pages follow a path). Bread crumb text should he headline capped.

## Linking (general guidance)
  - Avoid linking entire sentences or stand-alone phrases.
  - Try not to link more than about 5 words. This is a general target, but there are times when linking more than 5 words makes sense (for instance, when we link to a specific form that has a long name): Fill out the [Application for Dependency and Indemnity Compensation (VA Form 21-534)](http://www.vba.va.gov/pubs/forms/VBA-21-534-ARE.pdf).
    - **Too long:** The National Coalition for Homeless Veterans [lists by state all the women’s shelters available](http://www.nchv.org/index.php/help/help/locate_organization/).
    - **Relevent words linked:** The National Coalition for Homeless Veterans lists by state [all the women’s shelters available](http://www.nchv.org/index.php/help/help/locate_organization/).
  - Link the relevant words (usually this is more than a single word):
    - **Not meaningful:** VA maintains a [list](http://www.cem.va.gov/cem/cems/listcem.asp) of all the national and state VA cemeteries.
    - **Relevent words linked:** VA maintains a list of all the [national and state VA cemeteries](http://www.cem.va.gov/cem/cems/listcem.asp).
  - If a string of words at the end of a sentence is linked, use punctuation (usually a period) as grammar would dictate, but do not link the ending punctuation (the period should not be underlined along with the rest of the link). E.g.: You have an [Agent Orange‒related disability](https://www.vets.gov/disability-benefits/conditions/exposure-to-hazardous-materials/agent-orange/diseases/).
- external linking: Vets.gov uses an icon to alert Veterans, without being overly burdensome, that a link will take them to an external site. We don’t use a pop-up or a modal warning. This standard practice does not apply to external links in the vets.gov footer, where no icon accompanies the links to Twitter, Facebook, and other external pages.
  - An icon is autogenerated whenever there is a full link beginning with http, such as: http://vabenefits.vba.va.gov/vonapp/main.asp
  - No icon will appear when a link is relative (one that begins with a forward slash followed by the vets.gov section or page name) and takes Veterans to an internal vets.gov page, such as:
/disability-benefits/conditions/ptsd/.

**Note:** The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) does not require the use of pop-up notifications for outbound links. See [M-10-23](https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/assets/memoranda_2010/m10-23.pdf) and [M-05-04](https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/memoranda/fy2005/m05-04.pdf) for this official guidance.

## Interface Elements 
(Adapted from the ["Technical and interface writing"](https://pages.18f.gov/content-guide/technical-and-interface-writing/) section of the 18F Content Guide.)

Guide the customer with words reflective of the interface. Take the customer step by step through the process. Be specific about what the customer needs to click on or choose from. Use clear, active verbs to tell readers how to interact with interface elements:

- *Choose* from drop-down menus.
- *Select* or *deselect* checkboxes and radio buttons.
- *Click* or *tap* buttons.
- *Follow* or *open* links.

Emphasize the name of the interface label by making it bold:

In the **File** menu, choose **Save**.
Select **I agree**.
Click **Continue**.

In tools such as Résumé Builder and the Health Care Application, the boxes where Veterans enter information have descriptors above them identifying what information should be entered. For instance, "First name" and "Branch of service." Sentence cap these descriptors (so, not "First Name" and "Branch of Service").
