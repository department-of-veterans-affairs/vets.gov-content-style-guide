# The [VA.gov Design System and Content Style Guide](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/) has replaced the Vets.gov Content Style Guide.


# Vets.gov Content Style Guide

## Our guiding principle for Vets.gov content is that “doing” is better than “explaining.”
Our goal is to give Veterans the tools and content they need to complete a task—quickly and easily. We're constantly asking the question “what does a Veteran want to accomplish during this visit?” 

### Vets.gov Content Principles
Our content is:
 - Accurate
 - Written in plain language
 - Based on Veteran feedback, user research, VA call center data, and web analytics
 - Concise
 - Skimmable
 - Actionable
 - Accessible
 - Findable
 - Device agnostic
