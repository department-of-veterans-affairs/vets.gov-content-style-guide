# Content Structure (How will content be organized, formatted, and displayed?)

### Considerations for each piece of content:
-	Does the content need to be something you can search and sort by?
-	Is the content related to other content?
-	Does content need to be extracted to display elsewhere? Will it travel? (Future API development?)

### Navigation and Nomenclature 
-	Make labels intuitive and action-oriented
-	Ensure consistency across sections

### Metadata
-	To be added at a later date
