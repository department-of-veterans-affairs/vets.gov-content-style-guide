# Vets.gov Content Style Guide

## Our guiding principle for Vets.gov content is that “doing” is better than “explaining.”
Our goal is to give Veterans the tools and content they need to complete a task—quickly and easily. We're constantly asking the question “what does a Veteran want to accomplish during this visit?”
