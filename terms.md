## Terms

**Introduction:**

These words or phrases are not captured by, or run counter to, entries in CMS or M-W. Specifically, they:

- Have a different spelling or a different use of capitalization or hyphenation than what's found in CMS and M-W
- Surfaced during the concurrence process (e.g., say "VA claim exam" rather than "C&P exam"; say "decision notice" rather than "decision letter")
- Are VA-specific proper nouns (e.g., Veterans' Mortgage Life Insurance. We need to be accurate about whether a term is capitalized, plural, singular possessive, plural possessive, etc.)
- Are specific to VA forms and applications (e.g., Prisoner of War appears on the 10-10EZ capitalized, but it is lowercased in CMS and M-W. For consistency, we want to match capitalization style in forms. We also want to be accurate when referring to the names of blocks that Veterans fill in on forms.)

### A

- active duty: Hyphenate when it modifies a noun; do not cap (active-duty Servicemember)
- accredited representative: Lowercase.
- Armed Forces: Capitalize.

### B
- beneficiary: Avoid this term in favor of “family member” when appropriate.
- Benefits Delivery at Discharge (BDD) program: “Benefits” is plural.

### C

- can vs. may: Use "can" when meaning the ability or power to do something; use "may" when meaning the permission to do it.
- Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active Duty (DD214)
- certifying official (VA certifying official)
- character of service (more casually referred to as "type of service"): This is a "block" or box on the DD214 that states one of the following: honorable, general/under honorable conditions, under other than honorable conditions, uncharacterized, or bad conduct.
- claim exam: This is the C&P exam. The correct way to refer to it is "VA claim exam."
- click: Avoid using this word (especially the phrase "click here") to prompt users to click on a link; instead link the appropriate words. For example: “Find an [accredited representative](https://www.vets.gov/disability-benefits/apply-for-benefits/help/index.html) to help you.” or “Learn more about [evidence requirements](https://www.vets.gov/disability-benefits/claims-process/evidence/).”

### D

- deceased: Favor this word over "decedent," which is chiefly a legal term.
- Department of Veterans Affairs (no apostrophe)
- Dependents’ Educational Assistance Program (also called Survivors’ and Dependents’ Educational Assistance Program): Both terms are regularly shortened to DEA. 
- decision notice: We should *not* refer to this as the "decision letter." The Veteran undergoes a VA claim exam (casually referred to as a C&P exam), and then after VA reviews the evidence, they sent the Veteran a "decision notice" that includes the disability rating.

### E
- email: No hyphen.
- education (serving as an attributive noun to modify another noun)
  - education benefits: not educational benefits
  - education and training opportunities

  - educational counseling
    - educational and career counseling (this instance runs counter to the style within eBenefits > Apply > Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment Benefits > Education and Career Counseling, but aligns with VR&E Chapter 36 (Educational and Vocational Counseling)
    - educational and vocational counseling (to be consistent with VR&E Chapter 36: Educational and Vocational Counseling)
  - educational institution

  - educational program

In addition, the following related words do appear in Merriam-Webster as one: graveside and gravestone.)
- guarantee: Can be used as either a noun or a verb. For our purposes, especially within the Home Loans section, when used in a legal context, we use “guarantee” as a verb and “guaranty” as a noun. (“VA guarantees a portion of the loan.”)

### O
### P
