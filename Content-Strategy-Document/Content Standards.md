# Content Standards (How will we measure success?)

### Content Scorecard
The vets.gov Content Scorecard is a set of research-informed criteria to develop and assess vets.gov content. It’s focused on criteria (“items”) that enhance clarity and aid understanding, particularly for audiences who may have limited literacy skills or struggle with complex information.

The Scorecard supports the VA’s effort to comply with the Plain Writing Act of 2010 and meet the needs of diverse Veterans. All content on the site will score at least 85% on the vets.gov Content Scorecard. 

We strive to use the clearest language possible. However, we don’t use readability formulas to evaluate vets.gov content. These formulas don’t consider audience, purpose, or many other communication factors that contribute to clarity and comprehension. 

The vets.gov Content Scorecard can be used:
-	By vets.gov content creators during the development process to confirm that new content is in-line with best practices in clear communication
-	To help justify content and word-choice decisions to VA subject matter experts and other stakeholders
