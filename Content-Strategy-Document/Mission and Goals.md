# Mission & Goals

### Mission
Vets.gov enables Veterans to discover, apply for, track, and manage the benefits they have earned.

### Product Goals
-	Unifying and simplifying VA’s digital touch points, dramatically improving customer experience
-	Meeting customer need on the first try, on any device
-	Creating a mobile-first platform
-	Retooling existing applications and designing new end-to-end experiences, in partnership with business owners across VA
-	Providing transparency about our methods and processes


### Core Content Strategy
Curate an easy-to-use, easy-to-understand, interactive website that supports Veterans through the process of discovering, applying for, tracking, and managing their benefits. 

Explanation:
-	It’s not about VA; it’s about Veterans
-	VA content, vets.gov context. We’ll bring over actionable content that supports Veterans’ top tasks
-	At the end of the day, it’s transactional. Vets don’t want to sort through content that doesn’t help them reach their goals; we won’t waste their time
-	Benefits with a “lowercase b” – includes official benefits and other resources and services available to Veterans

*Guiding principle for all vets.gov content is that “doing” is better than “explaining.”
